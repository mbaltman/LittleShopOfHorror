# Little Shop Of Horror: The Game
This game was created for a game jam. The prompt was to make a game for a movie that did not have one yet. 
We settled on the 1986 adaptation of Little Shop Of Horror. 

The base game play was completed in just 3 days! 
Maxwell took the lead on code development while Jimmy created all of the art, animations, and assets.
